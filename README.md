# RSA-and-SHA-256-Algorithms-in-Blockchain

This project explores the integration of the RSA and SHA 256 algorithm into a simple blockchain. The SHA 256 algorithm is used to hash transaction data within the blockchain whereas RSA algorithm's key pair generation, encryption, and decryption processes are leveraged to enhance the security and authenticity of transactions within the blockchain. Each block in the blockchain contains an encrypted amount, digital signatures, and hash values, providing a secure and tamper-evident environment for data transfer. This project serves as an educational and practical exploration of RSA's application in the context of blockchain technology.

**Language and Tools:**
